### **1. Mention what Apache Kafka is?**  
📌 **Answer:**  
Apache Kafka is a **distributed, fault-tolerant, and scalable** messaging system that follows a **publish-subscribe model**. It is used for **real-time data streaming, event processing, and log aggregation**.  

🔹 **Key Features of Kafka:**  
- **High Throughput:** Handles millions of messages per second.  
- **Scalability:** Easily scales horizontally by adding more brokers.  
- **Durability:** Messages are replicated across multiple nodes.  
- **Fault Tolerance:** Works even if some nodes fail.  
- **Distributed by Design:** Uses multiple partitions for parallel processing.  

✅ Kafka is widely used in **big data pipelines, microservices communication, and event-driven architectures**.  

---

### **2. Mention what is the traditional method of message transfer?**  
📌 **Answer:**  
Traditional message transfer methods include:  

1. **Queuing Model:**  
   - A pool of consumers read messages from a queue.  
   - **Each message is delivered to only one consumer**.  
   - Example: **RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ**  

2. **Publish-Subscribe Model:**  
   - Messages are broadcasted to **all subscribers**.  
   - Each consumer gets its own copy.  
   - Example: **Kafka, Pub/Sub, MQTT**  

✅ **Kafka combines both models** through **consumer groups**:  
- Messages in a topic are shared among consumers in a **group (queue model)**.  
- Multiple consumer groups receive the same messages **(pub-sub model)**.  

---

### **3. Mention what are the benefits of Apache Kafka over the traditional technique?**  
📌 **Answer:**  

| **Feature** | **Kafka** | **Traditional Messaging** |
|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Speed** | Very fast (millions of messages/sec) | Slower |
| **Scalability** | Horizontally scalable | Limited |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Replicates data across nodes | Limited or No Replication |
| **Message Storage** | Stores messages persistently | Messages may expire |
| **Processing Model** | Works as both Queue & Pub-Sub | Mostly Queue-based |

✅ Kafka is **more efficient, durable, and scalable** than traditional messaging systems.  

---

### **4. Mention what is the meaning of Broker in Kafka?**  
📌 **Answer:**  
In Kafka, a **Broker** is a **server** that:  
- Stores data  
- Serves read/write requests  
- Manages partitions  
- Replicates data for fault tolerance  

🔹 **Example:** If you have a Kafka cluster with 3 brokers:  
- Each broker holds different partitions of a topic.  
- Producers send data to brokers, and consumers fetch it.  

✅ A **Kafka cluster usually consists of multiple brokers** for scalability and redundancy.  

---

### **5. Mention what is the Maximum Size of the Message that Kafka server can Receive?**  
📌 **Answer:**  
- The default maximum message size is **1 MB (1,000,000 bytes)**.  
- This can be changed using:  
  ```properties
  message.max.bytes=52428800  # (50 MB)
  ```
- However, **large messages can cause performance issues**.  

✅ **Solution:** Use **Kafka Streams** or **Chunking** for large data processing.  

---

### **6. Explain what is Zookeeper in Kafka and can we use Kafka without Zookeeper?**  
📌 **Answer:**  
**Zookeeper** is a distributed coordination service used by Kafka for:  
- **Leader election** (for partitions)  
- **Broker metadata management**  
- **Consumer group coordination**  
- **Fault detection**  

⚠️ **Can we use Kafka without Zookeeper?**  
**No**, Kafka **requires Zookeeper** to manage the cluster. However, **starting from Kafka 2.8, Zookeeper can be replaced by KRaft (Kafka Raft)**.  

✅ Zookeeper ensures **high availability** and prevents data inconsistency.  

---

### **7. Explain how messages are consumed by consumers in Kafka?**  
📌 **Answer:**  
Consumers **subscribe to topics** and read messages **from partitions**.  

🔹 **Steps:**  
1. **Consumers pull messages** from brokers.  
2. Each partition is assigned to **one consumer per group**.  
3. Consumers **commit offsets** to track progress.  

✅ Kafka uses **polling** instead of pushing messages to consumers.  

---

### **8. Explain how you can improve the throughput of a remote consumer?**  
📌 **Answer:**  
If the consumer is in a **different data center**, latency can be high.  

🔹 **Ways to Improve Throughput:**  
1. **Increase socket buffer size** (to handle network delays).  
2. **Use multiple consumer instances** (parallel processing).  
3. **Enable compression** (e.g., Snappy, LZ4).  
4. **Tune batch sizes and fetch settings** (`fetch.min.bytes`).  

✅ **Example Kafka Configurations:**  
```properties
socket.send.buffer.bytes=10485760
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=10485760
```

---

### **9. Explain how you can get Exactly Once Messaging from Kafka during data production?**  
📌 **Answer:**  
Kafka guarantees **at least-once** and **exactly-once** semantics.  

🔹 **Ways to achieve Exactly Once:**  
1. **Enable Idempotent Producer:**  
   ```properties
   enable.idempotence=true
   ```
2. **Use Transactions for Atomic Writes:**  
   - Ensures data is written **exactly once**, even if there are failures.  
   - Example: **Kafka Streams transactions**.  

✅ **Exactly-once is critical for financial transactions & order processing**.  

---

### **10. Explain how you can reduce churn in ISR and when does a Broker leave the ISR?**  
📌 **Answer:**  
**ISR (In-Sync Replicas)** contains **all replicas that are up-to-date with the leader**.  

🔹 **To reduce ISR churn:**  
1. Increase `replica.lag.time.max.ms` to avoid frequent ISR drops.  
2. Optimize network and disk I/O performance.  

✅ A broker leaves ISR if it **lags too much** or **becomes unavailable**.  

---

### **10. Explain how you can reduce churn in ISR and when does a Broker leave the ISR?**  

📌 **Answer:**  
ISR (**In-Sync Replicas**) are replicas that are fully caught up with the leader's data. If a replica falls behind, it is removed from the ISR. This process, called **ISR churn**, can cause instability in Kafka.  

🔹 **Causes of ISR Churn:**  
1. **Slow Replication** – If a replica is slow in fetching data from the leader, it may fall out of ISR.  
2. **High Network Latency** – Delayed data transfer can cause frequent ISR drops.  
3. **Under-provisioned Hardware** – Slow disk I/O or CPU bottlenecks can affect replica sync speed.  
4. **Frequent Leader Elections** – If leader changes frequently, replicas need to re-sync often.  

🔹 **How to Reduce ISR Churn?**  
1. **Increase the ISR timeout settings:**  
   ```properties
   replica.lag.time.max.ms=30000  # Increase time before a replica is removed from ISR
   ```
2. **Optimize the producer batch size to ensure efficient writes.**  
3. **Ensure network and disk performance is optimized for high throughput.**  

✅ **When does a broker leave the ISR?**  
- A broker **falls behind** the leader’s log due to high lag.  
- A broker **crashes or becomes unreachable**.  
- Kafka detects **high disk I/O or network issues**, causing the broker to lag.  

---

### **11. Why Replication is required in Kafka?**  

📌 **Answer:**  
Replication ensures **fault tolerance and high availability** in Kafka.  

🔹 **Why is replication needed?**  
- **Prevents data loss** if a broker crashes.  
- **Ensures availability** when a leader broker fails.  
- **Balances load** across Kafka brokers.  

🔹 **How Replication Works?**  
- Every partition has **one leader** and multiple **followers**.  
- **Followers replicate data from the leader.**  
- If a leader broker fails, a follower is **promoted** as the new leader.  

✅ **Example:**  
If a topic has **3 partitions with replication factor 2**, each partition will have **one leader and one follower** stored on different brokers.  

---

### **12. What does it indicate if a replica stays out of ISR for a long time?**  

📌 **Answer:**  
If a replica stays **out of ISR** for too long, it indicates:  
1. **High latency or slow data fetch** from the leader.  
2. **Network congestion** causing delays in replication.  
3. **Broker is overloaded** and cannot keep up with replication.  

✅ **Solution:**  
- Monitor replication lag using Kafka metrics.  
- Scale brokers if the load is too high.  
- Optimize producer and consumer configurations.  

---

### **13. Mention what happens if the preferred replica is not in the ISR?**  

📌 **Answer:**  
A **preferred replica** is the broker **originally assigned as the leader** for a partition.  

🔹 **If the preferred replica is not in the ISR:**  
- **Kafka cannot assign leadership** to it.  
- The controller **fails to move leadership** to the preferred replica.  
- **Can cause uneven load distribution** across brokers.  

✅ **Solution:**  
- Ensure that all replicas remain in the ISR by **monitoring lag**.  
- Avoid excessive partition movement in the cluster.  

---

### **14. Is it possible to get the Message Offset after Producing?**  

📌 **Answer:**  
No, a **Kafka producer does not directly get the message offset** after producing.  

🔹 **Why?**  
- Producers **fire-and-forget** messages for performance.  
- Offsets are assigned **by Kafka brokers** when messages are committed.  

🔹 **How to get the Offset?**  
1. Use `acks=all` and enable idempotency.  
2. Retrieve offsets using **Kafka Consumer API**.  

✅ **Example: Fetching Offsets in Consumer**  
```python
from confluent_kafka import Consumer

consumer = Consumer({
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092',
    'group.id': 'group1',
    'auto.offset.reset': 'earliest'
})

consumer.subscribe(['my_topic'])
msg = consumer.poll(1.0)

if msg:
    print(f"Offset: {msg.offset()}, Key: {msg.key()}, Value: {msg.value()}")
```

---

### **15. Mention what is the difference between Apache Kafka and Apache Storm?**  

📌 **Answer:**  

| Feature | **Apache Kafka** | **Apache Storm** |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Messaging system | Real-time stream processing |
| **Data Processing** | Stores and delivers messages | Processes & transforms data in real-time |
| **Persistence** | Stores messages for a configurable time | No built-in storage |
| **Use Case** | Event-driven apps, logs, messaging | Real-time analytics, fraud detection |
| **Integration** | Works with Spark, Flink, etc. | Can consume data from Kafka |

✅ **Kafka is used for event streaming, while Storm is used for real-time data processing.**  

---

### **16. List the various components in Kafka?**  

📌 **Answer:**  

1. **Topics** → Logical channel for messages.  
2. **Partitions** → Topics are split into partitions for parallelism.  
3. **Producers** → Publish messages to Kafka topics.  
4. **Brokers** → Kafka servers that store and manage partitions.  
5. **Consumers** → Read messages from topics.  
6. **Consumer Groups** → Multiple consumers working together.  
7. **Zookeeper** → Manages cluster metadata and leader elections.  

✅ **Kafka is a distributed system where producers, brokers, and consumers interact to process data.**  

---

### **17. Explain the role of the Offset?**  

📌 **Answer:**  
Offsets **uniquely identify messages** within a Kafka partition.  

🔹 **Why are offsets important?**  
- Keep track of **which messages are read**.  
- Allow consumers to **resume from the last processed message**.  

✅ **Example: Offset Management**  
```python
consumer.commit()  # Manually commit the latest offset
```

---

### **18. Explain the concept of Leader and Follower?**  

📌 **Answer:**  
Kafka **partitions** have a **leader** and one or more **followers**.  

🔹 **Leader**  
- Handles **all reads and writes** for the partition.  

🔹 **Follower**  
- **Replicates data** from the leader.  
- **Takes over as leader** if the original leader fails.  

✅ **Kafka ensures fault tolerance by electing new leaders dynamically.**  

---

### **19. How do you define a Partitioning Key?**  

📌 **Answer:**  
A **partitioning key** determines **which partition** a message goes to.  

🔹 **Default:** Uses **hashing-based partitioning** based on the key.  
🔹 **Custom:** Users can implement **custom partition logic**.  

✅ **Example: Assigning Partitions Manually**  
```python
producer.produce('topic', key='user1', value='message1')
```

---

### **20. In the Producer, when does QueueFullException occur?**  

📌 **Answer:**  
`QueueFullException` occurs when:  
- **The producer sends messages faster** than the broker can handle.  
- The broker **does not acknowledge** messages quickly.  

✅ **Solution:**  
1. Increase buffer size:  
   ```properties
   queue.buffering.max.messages=100000
   ```
2. Use **batching** instead of sending messages one by one.  

---

### **21. Explain the role of the Kafka Producer API?**  

📌 **Answer:**  
The **Kafka Producer API** allows applications to send data to Kafka topics.  

🔹 **Two Producer APIs:**  
1. **SyncProducer** → Sends messages **synchronously**.  
2. **AsyncProducer** → Sends messages **asynchronously** for better performance.  

✅ **Example: Kafka Producer in Python**  
```python
from confluent_kafka import Producer

producer = Producer({'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092'})
producer.produce('topic', key='key1', value='message1')
producer.flush()
```

---

### ✅ **Final Thoughts**  
- Kafka **guarantees fault tolerance with replication**.  
- **Offsets track message processing.**  
- **Producers must handle QueueFullException properly.**  
- **Leader-Follower ensures high availability.**
