# **GCP Kafka**

The provided files and instructions outline a system for publishing and consuming order data using Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Pub/Sub service. Below is a detailed explanation of each component and the overall workflow:

### 1. **Pub/Sub Setup in GCP (`Pub_Sub_Setup_In_GCP.txt`)**

This file provides instructions for setting up the necessary environment and permissions to use GCP's Pub/Sub service.

- **Python Package Installation**: 
  - The `google-cloud-pubsub` package is required to interact with GCP's Pub/Sub service. It can be installed using `pip3 install google-cloud-pubsub`.

- **Steps to Set Up Pub/Sub in GCP**:
  1. **Google Cloud SDK**: Ensure that the Google Cloud SDK is installed to use `gcloud` CLI commands.
  2. **Create Pub/Sub Topic**: Create a Pub/Sub topic named `orders_data` with default subscribers. This topic will be used to publish and consume messages.
  3. **Authentication**: Authenticate your GCP account using the command `gcloud auth application-default login`. This command opens a browser window where you can select the registered email ID for your GCP account.
  4. **IAM & Admin Roles**: In the IAM & Admin service, assign the necessary roles (`pub-sub producer` and `pub-sub subscriber`) to the email ID used in GCP. These roles allow the account to publish and subscribe to the Pub/Sub topic.

### 2. **Order Data Producer (`gcp_order_data_producer.py`)**

This script is responsible for generating mock order data and publishing it to the Pub/Sub topic.

- **Initialization**:
  - The script initializes a Pub/Sub publisher client using `pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()`.
  - It specifies the GCP project ID (`temp-123`) and the topic name (`topic`).

- **Mock Data Generation**:
  - The `generate_mock_data` function generates random order data, including fields like `order_id`, `customer_id`, `item`, `quantity`, `price`, `shipping_address`, `order_status`, and `creation_date`.
  - The data is serialized into JSON format and encoded to UTF-8 before publishing.

- **Publishing Data**:
  - The script enters an infinite loop where it continuously generates mock data, publishes it to the Pub/Sub topic, and waits for 1 second before generating the next order.
  - The `publish` method is used to send the data to the topic, and a callback function handles the publishing results, printing the message ID if successful.

### 3. **Order Data Consumer (`gcp_order_data_consumer.py`)**

This script subscribes to the Pub/Sub topic and processes the incoming order data.

- **Initialization**:
  - The script initializes a Pub/Sub subscriber client using `pubsub_v1.SubscriberClient()`.
  - It specifies the GCP project ID (`temp-123`) and the subscription name (`topic-sub`).

- **Pulling and Processing Messages**:
  - The `pull_messages` function continuously pulls messages from the subscription.
  - It processes up to 10 messages at a time, decodes the JSON data, and prints the deserialized data.
  - The script collects acknowledgment IDs (`ack_ids`) for each message and acknowledges them after processing to ensure they are not sent again.

- **Running the Consumer**:
  - The script runs the `pull_messages` function in a loop until interrupted by the user (e.g., via `KeyboardInterrupt`).

### **Overall Workflow**

1. **Setup**: 
   - Install the necessary Python package and set up the Pub/Sub topic and roles in GCP.
   
2. **Data Production**:
   - The producer script generates mock order data and publishes it to the Pub/Sub topic at regular intervals.

3. **Data Consumption**:
   - The consumer script subscribes to the Pub/Sub topic, pulls messages, processes them, and acknowledges receipt to prevent reprocessing.

### **Key Points**

- **Pub/Sub**: GCP's Pub/Sub is a messaging service that allows decoupling of services that produce events from services that process events.
- **Scalability**: The system is designed to handle a continuous stream of data, making it suitable for real-time data processing scenarios.
- **Fault Tolerance**: By acknowledging messages only after processing, the system ensures that messages are not lost if the consumer fails.

This setup is a basic example of how to use GCP's Pub/Sub for real-time data streaming and processing. It can be extended with more complex data processing, error handling, and scaling mechanisms as needed.

# **`gcp_order_data_producer.py`**

The `gcp_order_data_producer.py` script is a Python program designed to generate mock order data and publish it to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Pub/Sub topic. Below is a detailed explanation of the script, broken down into its key components:

---

### **1. Importing Required Libraries**
```python
import json
import time
import random
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
```
- **`json`**: Used to serialize Python dictionaries into JSON format, which is a common data format for messaging systems.
- **`time`**: Used to introduce delays (e.g., `time.sleep(1)`) between publishing messages.
- **`random`**: Used to generate random values for mock order data (e.g., random items, quantities, prices, etc.).
- **`google.cloud.pubsub_v1`**: The GCP Pub/Sub client library, which provides the necessary tools to interact with Pub/Sub topics.

---

### **2. Initializing the Pub/Sub Publisher Client**
```python
publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
```
- **`PublisherClient`**: This is the client object used to interact with the Pub/Sub service. It allows the script to publish messages to a specific topic.

---

### **3. Defining Project and Topic Details**
```python
project_id = "temp-123"
topic_name = "topic"
topic_path = publisher.topic_path(project_id, topic_name)
```
- **`project_id`**: The GCP project ID where the Pub/Sub topic is located. Replace `"temp-123"` with your actual GCP project ID.
- **`topic_name`**: The name of the Pub/Sub topic where messages will be published. Replace `"topic"` with the actual topic name.
- **`topic_path`**: Constructs the full path to the Pub/Sub topic using the `project_id` and `topic_name`. This path is required when publishing messages.

---

### **4. Callback Function for Handling Publishing Results**
```python
def callback(future):
    try:
        message_id = future.result()
        print(f"Published message with ID: {message_id}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error publishing message: {e}")
```
- **Purpose**: This function is called when a message is successfully published or if an error occurs during publishing.
- **`future.result()`**: Retrieves the message ID of the published message. This ID is unique for each message and can be used for tracking.
- **Error Handling**: If an exception occurs during publishing, it is caught and printed to the console.

---

### **5. Generating Mock Order Data**
```python
def generate_mock_data(order_id):
    items = ["Laptop", "Phone", "Book", "Tablet", "Monitor"]
    addresses = ["123 Main St, City A, Country", "456 Elm St, City B, Country", "789 Oak St, City C, Country"]
    statuses = ["Shipped", "Pending", "Delivered", "Cancelled"]

    return {
        "order_id": order_id,
        "customer_id": random.randint(100, 1000),
        "item": random.choice(items),
        "quantity": random.randint(1, 10),
        "price": random.uniform(100, 1500),
        "shipping_address": random.choice(addresses),
        "order_status": random.choice(statuses),
        "creation_date": "2024-06-30"
    }
```
- **Purpose**: Generates a mock order in the form of a Python dictionary.
- **Fields**:
  - `order_id`: A unique identifier for the order (passed as an argument).
  - `customer_id`: A random integer between 100 and 1000.
  - `item`: A randomly selected item from the `items` list.
  - `quantity`: A random integer between 1 and 10.
  - `price`: A random floating-point number between 100 and 1500.
  - `shipping_address`: A randomly selected address from the `addresses` list.
  - `order_status`: A randomly selected status from the `statuses` list.
  - `creation_date`: A fixed date (e.g., `"2024-06-30"`).

---

### **6. Publishing Data to the Pub/Sub Topic**
```python
order_id = 1
while True:
    data = generate_mock_data(order_id)
    json_data = json.dumps(data).encode('utf-8')

    try:
        future = publisher.publish(topic_path, data=json_data)
        future.add_done_callback(callback)
        future.result()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Exception encountered: {e}")

    time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second
    order_id += 1
```
- **Infinite Loop**: The script runs indefinitely, continuously generating and publishing mock order data.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Generate Mock Data**: Calls `generate_mock_data(order_id)` to create a mock order.
  2. **Serialize Data**: Converts the Python dictionary into a JSON string using `json.dumps()` and encodes it to UTF-8 format.
  3. **Publish Data**: Uses the `publisher.publish()` method to send the message to the Pub/Sub topic.
     - **`topic_path`**: The path to the topic where the message will be published.
     - **`data=json_data`**: The actual message data to be published.
  4. **Callback**: Attaches the `callback` function to handle the result of the publishing operation.
  5. **Error Handling**: Catches and prints any exceptions that occur during publishing.
  6. **Delay**: Waits for 1 second (`time.sleep(1)`) before generating and publishing the next order.
  7. **Increment `order_id`**: Increments the `order_id` for the next order.

---

### **7. Optional Reset Logic (Commented Out)**
```python
# if order_id > 80:
#     order_id = 1  # Reset the order_id back to 1 after reaching 500
```
- This commented-out code shows how you could reset the `order_id` after reaching a certain value (e.g., 80). This is useful if you want to reuse order IDs in a loop.

---

### **Key Features of the Producer Script**
1. **Mock Data Generation**: Generates realistic-looking order data with random values.
2. **Pub/Sub Integration**: Publishes the generated data to a GCP Pub/Sub topic.
3. **Error Handling**: Catches and logs errors during the publishing process.
4. **Continuous Operation**: Runs indefinitely, simulating a real-time data stream.

---

### **How It Works in Practice**
1. The script starts by initializing the Pub/Sub client and defining the topic path.
2. It enters an infinite loop where it:
   - Generates mock order data.
   - Serializes the data into JSON format.
   - Publishes the data to the specified Pub/Sub topic.
   - Waits for 1 second before repeating the process.
3. The `callback` function logs the message ID of successfully published messages or errors if publishing fails.

---

### **Example Output**
When running the script, you might see output like this:
```
Published message with ID: 1234567890
Published message with ID: 1234567891
Published message with ID: 1234567892
...
```
Each line indicates that a message was successfully published, along with its unique message ID.

---

### **Use Cases**
- **Testing**: This script can be used to test Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions by generating a continuous stream of mock data.
- **Simulation**: It simulates a real-world scenario where orders are continuously generated and published to a messaging system.
- **Integration**: It can be integrated into larger systems where order data needs to be streamed to downstream services for processing.

This script is a foundational example and can be extended with additional features like logging, dynamic topic names, or more complex data generation logic.

# **`gcp_order_data_consumer.py`**

The `gcp_order_data_consumer.py` script is a Python program designed to subscribe to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Pub/Sub topic, pull messages (order data) from the topic, process them, and acknowledge receipt of the messages. Below is a detailed explanation of the script, broken down into its key components:

---

### **1. Importing Required Libraries**
```python
import json
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
```
- **`json`**: Used to deserialize JSON data (received from Pub/Sub) into Python dictionaries.
- **`google.cloud.pubsub_v1`**: The GCP Pub/Sub client library, which provides the necessary tools to interact with Pub/Sub subscriptions.

---

### **2. Initializing the Pub/Sub Subscriber Client**
```python
subscriber = pubsub_v1.SubscriberClient()
```
- **`SubscriberClient`**: This is the client object used to interact with the Pub/Sub service. It allows the script to pull messages from a specific subscription.

---

### **3. Defining Project and Subscription Details**
```python
project_id = "temp-123"
subscription_name = "topic-sub"
subscription_path = subscriber.subscription_path(project_id, subscription_name)
```
- **`project_id`**: The GCP project ID where the Pub/Sub subscription is located. Replace `"temp-123"` with your actual GCP project ID.
- **`subscription_name`**: The name of the Pub/Sub subscription from which messages will be pulled. Replace `"topic-sub"` with the actual subscription name.
- **`subscription_path`**: Constructs the full path to the Pub/Sub subscription using the `project_id` and `subscription_name`. This path is required when pulling messages.

---

### **4. Pulling and Processing Messages**
```python
def pull_messages():
    while True:
        response = subscriber.pull(request={"subscription": subscription_path, "max_messages": 10})
        ack_ids = []

        for received_message in response.received_messages:
            # Extract JSON data
            json_data = received_message.message.data.decode('utf-8')
            
            # Deserialize the JSON data
            deserialized_data = json.loads(json_data)

            print(deserialized_data)
                      
            # Collect ack ID for acknowledgment
            ack_ids.append(received_message.ack_id)

        # Acknowledge the messages so they won't be sent again
        if ack_ids:
            subscriber.acknowledge(request={"subscription": subscription_path, "ack_ids": ack_ids})
```
- **Purpose**: This function continuously pulls messages from the subscription, processes them, and acknowledges receipt.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Pull Messages**:
     - The `subscriber.pull()` method is used to pull messages from the subscription.
     - The `request` parameter specifies the subscription path (`subscription_path`) and the maximum number of messages to pull at once (`max_messages=10`).
  2. **Process Messages**:
     - For each received message:
       - The message data is extracted from `received_message.message.data`.
       - The data is decoded from bytes to a UTF-8 string using `.decode('utf-8')`.
       - The JSON string is deserialized into a Python dictionary using `json.loads()`.
       - The deserialized data is printed to the console.
  3. **Collect Acknowledgment IDs**:
     - The `ack_id` of each message is collected in the `ack_ids` list. This ID is required to acknowledge the message later.
  4. **Acknowledge Messages**:
     - After processing all messages in the batch, the script acknowledges them using `subscriber.acknowledge()`.
     - Acknowledging messages ensures they are not sent again to this or other subscribers.

---

### **5. Running the Consumer**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        pull_messages()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
```
- **Purpose**: This block runs the `pull_messages()` function in a loop until the script is interrupted (e.g., by pressing `Ctrl+C`).
- **Steps**:
  1. The `pull_messages()` function is called, which continuously pulls and processes messages.
  2. If the user interrupts the script (e.g., with `Ctrl+C`), the `KeyboardInterrupt` exception is caught, and the script exits gracefully.

---

### **Key Features of the Consumer Script**
1. **Message Pulling**: Pulls messages from a Pub/Sub subscription in batches (up to 10 messages at a time).
2. **Message Processing**: Deserializes JSON data and prints it to the console.
3. **Acknowledgment**: Acknowledges messages after processing to ensure they are not sent again.
4. **Continuous Operation**: Runs indefinitely, simulating a real-time data processing system.

---

### **How It Works in Practice**
1. The script starts by initializing the Pub/Sub client and defining the subscription path.
2. It enters an infinite loop where it:
   - Pulls a batch of messages (up to 10) from the subscription.
   - Processes each message by decoding and deserializing the JSON data.
   - Prints the deserialized data to the console.
   - Collects acknowledgment IDs for all processed messages.
   - Acknowledges the messages to prevent them from being sent again.
3. The script continues running until interrupted by the user.

---

### **Example Output**
When running the script, you might see output like this:
```json
{
    "order_id": 1,
    "customer_id": 456,
    "item": "Laptop",
    "quantity": 2,
    "price": 1200.5,
    "shipping_address": "123 Main St, City A, Country",
    "order_status": "Shipped",
    "creation_date": "2024-06-30"
}
{
    "order_id": 2,
    "customer_id": 789,
    "item": "Phone",
    "quantity": 1,
    "price": 800.0,
    "shipping_address": "456 Elm St, City B, Country",
    "order_status": "Pending",
    "creation_date": "2024-06-30"
}
...
```
Each block represents a processed order message pulled from the Pub/Sub subscription.

---

### **Use Cases**
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: This script can be used to process real-time order data streamed from a producer (e.g., `gcp_order_data_producer.py`).
- **Testing**: It can be used to test Pub/Sub subscriptions and ensure messages are being delivered and processed correctly.
- **Integration**: It can be integrated into larger systems where order data needs to be consumed and processed by downstream services.

---

### **Extending the Script**
The script can be extended with additional features, such as:
- **Logging**: Use Python's `logging` module to log processed messages instead of printing them.
- **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for network issues or malformed messages.
- **Data Storage**: Store processed messages in a database or send them to another service for further processing.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Allow the project ID, subscription name, and other parameters to be configured via environment variables or command-line arguments.

This script is a foundational example and can be adapted to meet the needs of more complex systems.

# Flow of whole Code 

If you run `gcp_order_data_producer.py` and then `gcp_order_data_consumer.py`, the two scripts will work together to simulate a real-time data streaming and processing system using Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Pub/Sub service. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what will happen:

---

### **1. Running `gcp_order_data_producer.py`**
- **What Happens**:
  1. The producer script starts and initializes the Pub/Sub publisher client.
  2. It enters an infinite loop where it:
     - Generates mock order data using the `generate_mock_data()` function.
     - Serializes the data into JSON format and encodes it to UTF-8.
     - Publishes the data to the specified Pub/Sub topic (`topic` in project `temp-123`).
     - Waits for 1 second (`time.sleep(1)`) before generating and publishing the next order.
  3. The script continuously publishes order data to the Pub/Sub topic until it is manually stopped (e.g., by pressing `Ctrl+C`).

- **Example Output**:
  ```
  Published message with ID: 1234567890
  Published message with ID: 1234567891
  Published message with ID: 1234567892
  ...
  ```
  Each line indicates that a message was successfully published, along with its unique message ID.

---

### **2. Running `gcp_order_data_consumer.py`**
- **What Happens**:
  1. The consumer script starts and initializes the Pub/Sub subscriber client.
  2. It enters an infinite loop where it:
     - Pulls messages from the specified Pub/Sub subscription (`topic-sub` in project `temp-123`).
     - Processes up to 10 messages at a time.
     - For each message:
       - Decodes the message data from bytes to a UTF-8 string.
       - Deserializes the JSON data into a Python dictionary.
       - Prints the deserialized data to the console.
     - Collects acknowledgment IDs (`ack_ids`) for all processed messages.
     - Acknowledges the messages to ensure they are not sent again.
  3. The script continuously pulls and processes messages from the subscription until it is manually stopped (e.g., by pressing `Ctrl+C`).

- **Example Output**:
  ```json
  {
      "order_id": 1,
      "customer_id": 456,
      "item": "Laptop",
      "quantity": 2,
      "price": 1200.5,
      "shipping_address": "123 Main St, City A, Country",
      "order_status": "Shipped",
      "creation_date": "2024-06-30"
  }
  {
      "order_id": 2,
      "customer_id": 789,
      "item": "Phone",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 800.0,
      "shipping_address": "456 Elm St, City B, Country",
      "order_status": "Pending",
      "creation_date": "2024-06-30"
  }
  ...
  ```
  Each block represents a processed order message pulled from the Pub/Sub subscription.

---

### **3. Interaction Between Producer and Consumer**
- **Pub/Sub Topic and Subscription**:
  - The producer publishes messages to the Pub/Sub topic (`topic`).
  - The consumer pulls messages from the subscription (`topic-sub`) associated with the topic.

- **Message Flow**:
  1. The producer generates and publishes order data to the topic.
  2. The messages are stored in the Pub/Sub topic until they are pulled by a subscriber (in this case, the consumer script).
  3. The consumer pulls messages from the subscription, processes them, and acknowledges receipt.

- **Real-Time Processing**:
  - As long as both scripts are running, the producer will continuously publish new order data, and the consumer will continuously pull and process the data in real time.

---

### **4. Example Scenario**
1. **Start the Producer**:
   - Run `gcp_order_data_producer.py`.
   - The producer starts publishing order data to the Pub/Sub topic.

2. **Start the Consumer**:
   - Run `gcp_order_data_consumer.py`.
   - The consumer starts pulling and processing the order data published by the producer.

3. **Output**:
   - The producer outputs the message IDs of successfully published messages.
   - The consumer outputs the deserialized order data pulled from the subscription.

4. **Stopping the Scripts**:
   - If you stop the producer, the consumer will continue to pull and process any remaining messages in the subscription.
   - If you stop the consumer, the producer will continue to publish messages, which will accumulate in the Pub/Sub topic until a consumer pulls them.

---

### **Key Points**
- **Decoupling**: The producer and consumer are decoupled. The producer does not need to know about the consumer, and vice versa. Pub/Sub acts as an intermediary, ensuring reliable message delivery.
- **Scalability**: Multiple consumers can subscribe to the same topic, allowing for scalable and parallel processing of messages.
- **Fault Tolerance**: If the consumer fails or is stopped, messages remain in the subscription until they are processed. The acknowledgment mechanism ensures that messages are not lost.

---

### **Use Case**
This setup simulates a real-world scenario where:
- A system (producer) generates and streams order data.
- Another system (consumer) processes the order data in real time.

For example:
- An e-commerce platform generates orders (producer).
- A fulfillment system processes the orders (consumer).

---

### **Extending the System**
- **Multiple Consumers**: You can run multiple instances of the consumer script to process messages in parallel.
- **Error Handling**: Add error handling in the consumer to retry failed messages or log errors.
- **Data Storage**: Modify the consumer to store processed messages in a database or send them to another service.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Use environment variables or configuration files to dynamically set the project ID, topic name, and subscription name.

By running these scripts together, you can simulate and test a real-time data streaming and processing pipeline using GCP Pub/Sub.

# **`Best Practices`**

When working with **Google Cloud Pub/Sub** and building systems like the one described in your scripts (`gcp_order_data_producer.py` and `gcp_order_data_consumer.py`), it's important to follow best practices to ensure **scalability**, **reliability**, and **efficiency**. Below are some best practices for both producers and consumers:

---

## **1. Best Practices for Producers**

### **a. Batch Publishing**
- **Why**: Publishing messages in batches reduces the number of API calls, which improves efficiency and reduces costs.
- **How**: Use the `batch_settings` parameter in the `PublisherClient` to configure batch size and latency.
  ```python
  from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

  batch_settings = pubsub_v1.types.BatchSettings(
      max_messages=100,  # Maximum number of messages per batch
      max_bytes=1024,    # Maximum size of a batch in bytes
      max_latency=1,     # Maximum latency in seconds for batching
  )
  publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient(batch_settings)
  ```

### **b. Error Handling**
- **Why**: Network issues or quota limits can cause publishing failures.
- **How**: Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient errors.
  ```python
  from google.api_core import retry

  future = publisher.publish(topic_path, data=json_data, retry=retry.Retry(deadline=300))
  ```

### **c. Message Ordering**
- **Why**: If message order is important (e.g., for sequential events), enable message ordering.
- **How**: Use the `ordering_key` parameter when publishing messages.
  ```python
  future = publisher.publish(topic_path, data=json_data, ordering_key="order-123")
  ```

### **d. Monitoring and Logging**
- **Why**: Monitoring helps track the health and performance of the producer.
- **How**: Use **Cloud Monitoring** and **Cloud Logging** to track metrics like publish latency, message count, and errors.
  ```python
  import logging
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
  ```

---

## **2. Best Practices for Consumers**

### **a. Acknowledge Messages Only After Processing**
- **Why**: Acknowledging messages too early can result in data loss if the consumer crashes before processing.
- **How**: Acknowledge messages only after they have been successfully processed.
  ```python
  for received_message in response.received_messages:
      try:
          process_message(received_message)
          ack_ids.append(received_message.ack_id)
      except Exception as e:
          logging.error(f"Failed to process message: {e}")
  ```

### **b. Use Streaming Pull**
- **Why**: Streaming pull is more efficient than synchronous pull for high-throughput systems.
- **How**: Use the `subscribe` method for streaming pull.
  ```python
  def callback(message):
      try:
          process_message(message)
          message.ack()
      except Exception as e:
          logging.error(f"Failed to process message: {e}")

  streaming_pull_future = subscriber.subscribe(subscription_path, callback=callback)
  ```

### **c. Handle Duplicate Messages**
- **Why**: Pub/Sub guarantees **at-least-once** delivery, so consumers must handle duplicate messages.
- **How**: Implement idempotent processing or use a deduplication mechanism (e.g., storing processed message IDs in a database).

### **d. Scale Consumers Horizontally**
- **Why**: Multiple consumers can process messages in parallel, improving throughput.
- **How**: Run multiple instances of the consumer script and ensure they are stateless.

## **3. General Best Practices**

### **a. Use Dead-Letter Topics**
- **Why**: To handle messages that cannot be processed after multiple retries.
- **How**: Configure a dead-letter topic for your subscription.
  ```bash
  gcloud pubsub subscriptions update topic-sub --dead-letter-topic=dead-letter-topic
  ```

### **b. Monitor Pub/Sub Metrics**
- **Why**: Monitoring helps identify bottlenecks, errors, and performance issues.
- **How**: Use **Cloud Monitoring** to track metrics like:
  - **Publish latency**
  - **Subscription backlog (unacknowledged messages)**
  - **Message delivery rate**

### **c. Set Up Alerts**
- **Why**: Alerts notify you of issues like high message backlog or publishing failures.
- **How**: Use **Cloud Monitoring** to create alerting policies for critical metrics.

### **d. Use IAM Roles and Permissions**
- **Why**: Restrict access to Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions to authorized users and services.
- **How**: Assign minimal required roles (e.g., `roles/pubsub.publisher` for producers and `roles/pubsub.subscriber` for consumers).

## **4. Performance Optimization**

### **a. Optimize Message Size**
- **Why**: Large messages can increase latency and costs.
- **How**: Compress large messages or split them into smaller chunks.

### **b. Use Regional Endpoints**
- **Why**: Reduces latency by keeping data within a specific region.
- **How**: Specify a regional endpoint when initializing the Pub/Sub client.
  ```python
  publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient(client_options={"api_endpoint": "us-central1-pubsub.googleapis.com:443"})
  ```

### **c. Tune Subscription Settings**
- **Why**: Improves message delivery performance.
- **How**: Adjust settings like:
  - **Ack deadline**: Increase if processing takes longer.
  - **Flow control**: Limit the number of messages pulled at once to avoid overwhelming the consumer.

## **5. Security Best Practices**

### **a. Encrypt Data**
- **Why**: Protects sensitive data in transit and at rest.
- **How**: Use **Google-managed encryption keys** or **customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)**.

### **b. Use Service Accounts**
- **Why**: Service accounts provide secure, granular access control.
- **How**: Use service accounts for producers and consumers instead of user accounts.

### **c. Enable VPC Service Controls**
- **Why**: Restricts access to Pub/Sub resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
- **How**: Configure VPC Service Controls for your project.

## **6. Testing and Debugging**

### **a. Test with Mock Data**
- **Why**: Ensures the system works as expected before deploying to production.
- **How**: Use scripts like `gcp_order_data_producer.py` to generate test data.

### **b. Use Emulators**
- **Why**: Allows local testing without connecting to GCP.
- **How**: Use the **Pub/Sub Emulator** for local development and testing.

### **c. Log and Debug**
- **Why**: Helps identify and fix issues quickly.
- **How**: Use structured logging and include context (e.g., message ID, timestamp) in logs.

## **7. Cost Optimization**

### **a. Minimize Message Size**
- **Why**: Pub/Sub pricing is based on message volume.
- **How**: Avoid sending unnecessary data in messages.

### **b. Use Batch Settings**
- **Why**: Reduces the number of API calls, lowering costs.
- **How**: Configure batch settings for producers.

### **c. Monitor Usage**
- **Why**: Helps identify cost-saving opportunities.
- **How**: Use **Cloud Billing Reports** to track Pub/Sub usage and costs.
